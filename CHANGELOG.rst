^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added
-----

- option to create template for new utterance action in ``interactive learning``
- you can now choose actions previously created in the same session
in ``interactive learning``
- add formatter 'black'


Changed
-------
- changed removing punctuation logic in ``WhitespaceTokenizer``
- ``training_processes`` in the Rasa NLU data router have been renamed to ``worker_processes``
- created a common utils package ``rasa.utils`` for nlu and core, common methods like ``read_yaml`` moved there

Removed
-------
- removed possibility to execute ``python -m rasa_core.train`` etc. (e.g. scripts in ``rasa.core`` and ``rasa.nlu``).
  Use the CLI for rasa instead, e.g. ``rasa train core``.

Fixed
-----
- evaluating core stories with two stage fallback gave an error, trying to handle None for a policy
- the ``/evaluate`` route for the Rasa NLU server now runs evaluation
  in a parallel process, which prevents the currently loaded model unloading
- added missing implementation of the ``keys()`` function for the Redis Tracker
  Store
